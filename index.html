            My Name is Alexis Tanner, but my friends call me Lex!
            I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, where
            I still currently reside.
            A few of my many hobbies are eating, sleeping,
            shopping, and traveling.
            My next big trip is going to be to Brazil and I am so elated.

            I currently work for Best Buy's very own Geek Squad, as a Subject Matter Expert.
            I have been with Geek Squad for almost three years and I learn something new everyday.
            My job is exciting because it allows me to exercise my problem solving and critical
            thinking skills with real-live scenarios. Soon, I plan to start a tech company,
            mainly focusing my services on installations, web/program design, advertising,
            software troubleshooting, and technical support.
